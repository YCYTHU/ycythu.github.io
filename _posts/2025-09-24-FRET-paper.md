Sensitized organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer require high Förster resonance energy transfer efficiency ($\varPhi_\text{FRET}$) to achieve high efficiency and color purity. Since the energy transfer process involves complex interactions between two distinct molecules in amorphous solid film, it remains far from been understood and needs deep insights. Herein, taking two representative sensitizers, non-rigid donor-π-acceptor type DMAC-TRZ and rigid donor-spiro-acceptor type ACRSA as examples, we first established a reliable multiscale model based on the picture of energy transfer process and obtained experimentally verified energy transfer rates ($k_\text{FRET}\sim 10^7\ s^{-1}$), then performed molecular-level calculations to explore the interplay of intermolecular interactions and molecular rigidity in governing $\varPhi_\text{FRET}$. For non-rigid DMAC-TRZ, it is not the commonly-believed intrinsic conformer variation via the dihedral angle between donor and π unit, but strong intermolecular interactions with terminal emitter at short distance that induce undesirable low-energy conformers with large variation in the dihedral angle between acceptor and π unit, which further result in anomalous reduction of Frank-Condon factor weighted density of states (FCWD) and thus lower-than-expected $k_\text{FRET}$ and $\varPhi_\text{FRET}$. For ACRSA, it is rigid spirocyclic structure that greatly weaken intermolecular interactions and preserve an almost distance-independent molecular conformation, thus facilitate nearly uniform FCWD parameters and superior $k_\text{FRET}$ and $\varPhi_\text{FRET}$. Our study provides fresh insights into the critical role of intermolecular interactions mediated conformational dynamics in energy transfer, revealing a blind and vital point behind molecular rigidity in developing high-performance sensitized OLEDs.
